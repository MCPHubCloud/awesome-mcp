# awesome-mcp
A collection of **Model Context Protocol** (MCP) servers/clients. 
The project is actively maintained and welcomes contributions or pull requests (PRs) to help improve it further

**mcphub.cloud aims to hosting mcp servers to make mcp easy use for everyone. (On the way)**

## Model Context Protocol
The Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open-standard developed by Anthropic, addresses challenges in integrating large language models (LLMs) with external data sources, tools, and resources. It standardizes how LLMs interact with these systems, simplifying tasks like input handling and data processing to enhance AI applications' practicality and security.

MCP acts as a standardized bridge, enabling seamless access for LLMs to diverse data sources and tools while ensuring reliable and safe interactions in AI development. This protocol reduces complexity by providing a unified framework for connecting models with external systems.
